## My process

### Built with

- ES6+ (async/await, fetch API)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 media queries
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Deck of Cards API

### What I learned

With this challenge I trained the concept of asyncronous programming in Javascript. I fetch data from Deck of Cards API (images, id, card values) and used it in the game.  

### Continued development

In future projects I'm going to focus more on complex layouts and using APIs.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell | CSS Evangelist](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) - My favourite teacher for RWD and CSS as a whole. Highly recommend it!
- [Deck of cards API] (https://deckofcardsapi.com/) - nice, free to use API if you want to build a card game
